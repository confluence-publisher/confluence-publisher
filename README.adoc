= Confluence Publisher

The Confluence Publisher allows documentation written in AsciiDoc and versioned directly with the documented code base
to be published to a Confluence space. It supports a "docs-as-code" approach.

It converts the resulting AsciiDoc HTML output to XHTML compatible with
Confluence, manages included resources as Confluence attachments and ensures that only content modified since the last
publication is again re-published.

== Vision and Scope

The Confluence Publisher shall support writing conceptual and technical documentation such as design/architecture/product
documentation. In doing so, it tries to balance a useful feature set with acceptable maintenance efforts for the software
itself.

As a consequence, the Confluence Publisher does neither aim to support every concept from AsciiDoc nor every feature or 
macro found in Confluence.

== Documentation

The documentation of the current release version is published to https://confluence-publisher.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CPD/overview[https://confluence-publisher.atlassian.net].

== Contributing

Contributions are highly appreciated. In order to avoid lost efforts, consider first opening an issue describing
your idea/requirement and discuss whether the feature fits the vision and scope of the Confluence Publisher.

Please see the link:CONTRIBUTING.md[contribution guide] for instructions on how to build the Confluence Publisher 
locally and what to check before sending a pull request.
