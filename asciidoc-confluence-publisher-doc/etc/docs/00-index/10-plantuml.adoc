= PlantUML

PlantUML diagrams in AsciiDoc files are automatically generated using AsciiDoc Diagram, added as an attachment to the
corresponding Confluence page and inserted into the page using the Confluence image tag.


== Embedded PlantUML Source

PlantUML sources can be embedded directly into an AsciiDoc file and are replaced by the generated image when the
AsciiDoc file is published to Confluence.
